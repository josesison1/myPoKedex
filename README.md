# Jose's PoKeDex 

## Application Description
PoKedex is a built application utilizing an external API. Fetching specific data about a pokemon such as the pokemon's number, name, and type. It is built purely off Javascript, HTML and CSS. A side project that I did just to get hands-on practice with using API's and iterating through and filtering specific data that can be viewed and displayed.
